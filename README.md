# AIoT and Climate Change: AI-First Course Package

Generated 5 August 2026. Supersedes the sensor-chapter structure of the Rev5 manual; the Rev5 hardware facts (packaging story, compatibility matrix, datasheet-reading habit) carry forward inside the new decks.

## Getting started (students)

Get your laptop ready for the workshop with one command - no download, no git, no manual setup steps:

```
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sriram-rs/IEEE-BLP-AIoT-Stack/feature/onboarding-scripts/bootstrap.sh | bash
```
(macOS/Linux) or, in PowerShell on Windows:
```
iwr https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sriram-rs/IEEE-BLP-AIoT-Stack/feature/onboarding-scripts/bootstrap.ps1 -UseBasicParsing | iex
```

Already have the code on your machine some other way? Just run `python3 start_installation.py` (macOS/Linux) or `python start_installation.py` (Windows) from inside it.

Either way, this sets up everything the gateway needs and runs its self-test. See `gateway/README.md` for what to do next. Full prerequisites and manual-download alternatives (students and instructors) are in `PREREQUISITES.md`.

| `gateway.sh` / `gateway.bat` | Run any gateway command after setup, e.g. `bash gateway.sh simulate`, with no manual environment activation |
| `PREREQUISITES.md` | What you need installed, split by role: students (just Python) vs. instructors/content authors (also `python-pptx`, via `--with-pptx`) |
| `firmware/rehearsal_advertiser/` | Single-sketch ESP32 known-good radio reference |
| `firmware/sim-firmware/` | Production SIM firmware: PlatformIO, 5 variants, modular sensors, pins in one header |

Each deck: nine slides. Slides 1-3 are the AI-first opening, kept deliberately simple for a wide audience: the old way versus the new way of perceiving this quantity, what the AI must know about this sensor to be trusted with it, and one named agentic design pattern per deck (the pattern vocabulary table is in the architecture doc, Section 9). Slides 4-9: what it is, practice, technical card, climate change, fusion partners, capstone. Full spoken narration per slide. Packaged sensor dimensions and connector details are `[PLACEHOLDER]` pending final packaging.

## How to turn a deck into a PPT

Each `## Slide` heading is one slide; `**Slide content**` bullets go on the slide body; `**Narration**` goes into the speaker notes. A python-pptx script can consume these files mechanically since the structure is fixed.
