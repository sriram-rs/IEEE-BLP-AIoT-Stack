# Downloads the AIoT gateway course code and runs the one-command setup, so
# a student can go from nothing to a working environment with one line:
#
#   iwr <raw-url-of-this-file> -UseBasicParsing | iex
#
# To pass extra flags through (e.g. --with-pptx), download this file first,
# then run it directly:
#
#   .\bootstrap.ps1 --with-pptx
#
# IMPORTANT: this never calls "exit". When this file's content is piped
# into "iex" (Invoke-Expression) - the whole point of the one-liner - it
# runs inline in the CURRENT PowerShell session, not as a separate process,
# so a bare "exit" would close the student's entire PowerShell window
# instantly, wiping out every message before they can read it.
#
# It also deliberately does NOT wrap the logic in a function whose result
# gets assigned to a variable (e.g. "$code = MyFunction"). Doing that once
# caused a real bug here: capturing a function's return value captures
# EVERYTHING it emits, including every line of console output from the
# nested setup process invoked below - so the "exit code" variable ended
# up as a giant array of all that text with the real number tacked on the
# end, and a single-element array like @(0) evaluates as falsy in an "if",
# making a successful run look like a failure. Using a plain top-level
# "do { ... } while ($false)" block with "break" for early exits avoids
# this entirely, since nothing is ever captured from an assignment.
